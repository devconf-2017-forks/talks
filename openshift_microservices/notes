# How to leverage containers to run microservices on scale


## Description

According to Martin Fowler, microservices "is an approach to developing a single
application as a suite of small services". That definition sounds very promising,
isn't it? Yet, is it really that simple; how fast you're able to respond to fast
changing requirements and the growth? During this presentation I'll show you how
to migrate from virtualenv-based environments to fully automated, container-based
PaaS solution.


## Audience

Developers interested in: automated CI/CD flows, containers. PaaS solutions
supporting the former.


## Objective

Attendees leaving the room will know how to migrate from virtualenv-based deployments
to container-based ones. How to introduce fully automated CI/CD flow by leveraging
containers, combined with 21st century cluster management, hidden in the latest
version of OpenShift.


## Detailed abstract

According to Martin Fowler, microservices "is an approach to developing a single
application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and
communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These
services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by
fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized
management of these services, which may be written in different programming
languages and use different data storage technologies."

That definition sounds very promising and makes you think about microservices
architecture as something very easy. But is it really that simple to create such
services? If you think about each of the pieces separately then maybe the answer
is "yes", but what about that moment when your project grows into more than 5 tasks?
What about deploying them into tens, hundreds or thousands of instances? What about
rolling out a new release of a single component or even dozens of them?

You can see that the problem becomes very complex, very quickly. But now can you
imagine a world where doing such complex tasks will be as easy as pressing one
button (or invoking one command for CLI nerds ;))? If that sounds interesting to
you, come join me and I'll show you the amazing features and possibilities the
brand new OpenShift v3 has to offer.

I don't like just talking about ideas; I prefer live action. This means my
presentation will end with a live demo, where you'll be able to see how easy it is
to run OpenShift by yourself and leverage its features to simplify your processes
making both your development and operational team happy.
To add more to it, the presentation will have an accompanying repository with
sample application shown during the live demo and detailed instructions how to
run it on your own.
