Microservices on OpenShift v3
-----------------------

According to wikipedia (??? try microservices.io) microservices (in computing
of course ;)) "is a software architecture style, in which complex applications
are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using
language-agnostic APIs. These services are small, highly decoupled and focus on
doing a small task." That definition sounds very promising and makes you think
about miscroservices architecture as something very easy. Is it really that
simple to create such services? If you think about each of the separately then
I'd say yes, but what about that moment when your project grows into more than
5 or more tasks? What about deploying them into tens, hundreds or thousands of
instances? Can you imagine world where doing such complex task will be as easy as
pressing one button (or invoking one CLI command for CLI nerds ;)). If that sounds
interesting to you come join me and I'll show you the amazing features and possibilities
the brand new OpenShift v3 has to offer. I don't like talking too much about how
it was done so major part of my presentation will be a live demo where you'll
be able to see how easy it is to run OpenShift by yourself and leverage its
features to simplify your development and operational processes.
