Microservices on OpenShift v3
-----------------------

According to the Internet, microservices (in computing of course ;)) "is a software
architecture style, in which complex applications are composed of small, independent
processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. These services
are small, highly decoupled and focus on doing a small task." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
That definition sounds very promising and makes you think about miscroservices
architecture as something very easy. But is it really that simple to create such
services? If you think about each of the pieces separately then maybe the answer
is "yes", but what about that moment when your project grows into more than 5 tasks?
What about deploying them into tens, hundreds or thousands of instances? What about
rolling out a new release of a single component or even dozens of them?

You can see that the problem becomes very complex, very quickly. But now can you
imagine a world where doing such complex tasks will be as easy as pressing one
button (or invoking one command for CLI nerds ;))? If that sounds interesting to
you, come join me and I'll show you the amazing features and possibilities the
brand new OpenShift v3 has to offer.

I don't like talking too much about ideas; I prefer live action. This means the
major part of my presentation will be live demo where you'll be able to see how
easy it is to run OpenShift by yourself and leverage its features to simplify your
processes making both your development and operational team happy.
