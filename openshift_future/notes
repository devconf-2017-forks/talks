The future of OpenShift
-----------------------

In the mysterious land of PaaS, there's one I'd like you to have a closer look at,
OpenShift from Red Hat. I'll try to show you how you can benefit from using it,
starting with basic features to allow you to setup a small, homegrown project.
Then you can scale it up with more advanced features, as your project grows into
larger complexity software with high loads. Finally I'll cover transitioning to
hosting your own OpenShift installation. More than that, I'll show you how you can also
be part of that project. Afterwards we'll have a little peek at what's going on
in the next generation of OpenShift, and what Docker and Kubernetes are doing
there. We'll have a live demo to see how simple and developer friendly this new
version is going to be.
