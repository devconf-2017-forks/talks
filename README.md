Talks
-----

This repository contains all materials (slides, notes, code samples, etc.) from
different talks I've given. Along with build script used for producing html slides
from plain, markdown text files. The build script uses internally
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for generating slides.
