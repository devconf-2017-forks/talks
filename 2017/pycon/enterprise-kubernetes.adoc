## Enterprise Kubernetes Distribution

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and
operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing
container-centric infrastructure.

OpenShift is a distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application
development and multi-tenant deployment. OpenShift adds developer and
operations-centric tools on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application
development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance
for small and large teams.

The following diagram nicely shows how the entire stack is composed. The red boxes
represent the base operating system (can be Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS,
Fedora, etc.), the blue ones represent Kubernetes, and the green ones - OpenShift.
