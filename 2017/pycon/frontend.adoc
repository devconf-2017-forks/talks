## Frontend

Create our application frontend using following command:

[source]
----
oc new-app \
    soltysh/lighttpd-centos7~https://github.com/soltysh/blast.git \
    --context-dir=ui \
    --name=ui \
    --labels=app=ui
----

This will result in OpenShift creating the following resources for us:
