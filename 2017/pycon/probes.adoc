## Probes

After a few minutes, our application should be up and ready, but we want
the platform to monitor for its link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/application_health.html[liveness and readiness].
Liveness - verifies the pod is healthy, iow. running, when this fails
the scheduler will restart the container.  Readiness on the other hand, goes
one step further, and checks whether your application is ready to accept
requests, iow. when it can accept traffic.  Actually, the web console will
suggest you that you should add those checks:

To set both probes for our newly created application we'll do:

[source]
----
oc set probe dc/ui --liveness --open-tcp=8080
----

To verify our server is up and running.

[source]
----
oc set probe dc/ui --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/
----

To verify that the server is returning some content on /.
