## Application Architecture

During this workshop we are going to build a simple search engine consisting of
the following components:

- ui - is a React frontend application gathering results from three backends.
- text - which is python-based Flask REST application responsible for text-based
data and accompanying database.
- image - which is python-based Flask REST application responsible for image-based
data and accompanying database.
- video - which is python-based Flask REST application responsible for video-based
data and accompanying database.
- scraper - which is responsible for scraping web and saving text data in appropriate database.
