## Application Architecture

During this workshop we are going to build a simple search engine. The application
consists of the following components:

- *ui* - a React front end application presenting results gathered from the three
back ends.
- *text* - a python-based Flask REST application responsible for text-based data
and accompanying database.
- *image* - a python-based Flask REST application responsible for image-based data
and accompanying database.
- *video* - a python-based Flask REST application responsible for video-based data
and accompanying database.
- *scraper* - a web scraper feeding text database.

The application source code is available at {{BLAST_REPO}}, each subdirectory in
that repository represents the above elements.
