## ConfigMap

On the Deployment Config configuration page, see Volumes section, there's a
link allowing you to Add Config Files:

image::add_config.png[Add ConfigMap]

On the next screen we'll pick Create ConfigMap and fill it in with required
data:

[NOTE]
====
Both user name and password can be random strings, but database name needs to
be `blast_text`.
====

ConfigMap can be consumed in few possible ways:

- as environment variables
- as files

Once that is done we'll use a nice shorthand command to point both of our text deployments to the newly created config map:

[source]
----
oc set env dc/text-db --from=configmap/text
oc set env dc/text --from=configmap/text
----
