## Alternative Installations

During this workshop you will be provided with an environment, as it was already
mentioned, but if you are interested in running those examples back at home here
are the possible ways you can play with OpenShift:

. https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift Online] - which gives you access to 1GiB
  of storage and memory.
. https://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] - which runs a single-node
  OpenShift cluster in a pre-configured VM.
. https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[oc cluster up] -
  which sets up a local all-in-one cluster using docker containers.
