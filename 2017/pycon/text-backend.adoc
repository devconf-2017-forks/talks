## Text back-end

This time let's try using the web UI to create one of the python back-ends.
Click __Add to project__ at the top and pick python 3.5 builder image:

image::text_app.png[Test Application]

[NOTE]
====
Don't forget to click `advanced options` and set `Context Dir` to `text`.
====

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:

[source]
----
oc new-app \
    https://github.com/soltysh/blast.git \
    --context-dir=text \
    --name=text \
    --image-stream=python:3.5 \
    --labels=app=text

oc expose svc/text
----

Once the application builds, we should have the back-end up and running.
Unfortunately, it looks like it's not working as expected, let's debug what's
wrong with our application.  Click __#1__:

image::failed_deployment.png[Failed Deployment]

and dive into deployment details:

image::failed_pod.png[Failed Pod]

to check the pod logs running our application:

image::pod_logs.png[Pod Logs]

Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

[source]
----
oc get pods -l app=text
----

Which will return you a list of pods associated with our application.  The
`-l app=text` filters the pods to all that have the label `app` set to value `
text`.  This happens automatically for every application created using web
console, but can be done manually when using `oc new-app` with `--labels` flag.

[source]
----
oc logs text-1-p07pm
----

Make sure to use your own pod name here with `oc logs` command to get the logs
of from the deployment.

That's right our python runtime has a few requirements.  Let's check the python link:https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-python-container[S2I builder image] for details.

** Describe S2I python builder **

To solve our problem we need to set `APP_MODULE=api:app` environment variable:

image::set_env.png[Set Environment Variable]

Alternatively:

[source]
----
oc set env dc/text APP_MODULE=api:app
----

Like previously, let's configure the application liveness and readiness probes:

[source]
----
oc set probe dc/text --liveness --open-tcp=8080
oc set probe dc/text --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/blast/api/v1.0/text/x
----

Now that we've added the probes, we see that the application is not being
deployed properly.  Let's try to debug what's wrong with it.  Looking into
events shows the readiness probe failed:

image::failed_readiness.png[Failed Readiness]

The reason readiness failed is that the search back-end wasn't able to connect
to database:
