## Routes

Our final step is to expose the application to the outside world, to do
that we'll use the following command:

[source]
----
oc expose svc/ui
----

image:route.png[Route]

By now we should be able to reach our application, you can see the route
address with:

[source]
----
oc get route/ui
----

Or check the overview page in the web console.
