# Colorful deployments

## Description

You have created your awesome application, deployed it for the very first time,
now what? How you handle application updates, what are the possible approaches?
Do you pick your deployment strategy by your favorite color, blue-green, canary,
other? Yet, the decision is very simple, or I should rather say switching from
one strategy to other is as simple as never before. During this presentation
I will show you three different deployment strategies and how to apply those
to a sample application.


## Audience

Developers interested in: automated CI/CD flows, containers. PaaS solutions supporting the former.


## Objective

Attendees leaving the room will learn about different deployments strategies. How
to introduce fully automated CI/CD flow by leveraging  containers, combined with
21st century cluster management, hidden in the latest version of OpenShift.


## Detailed abstract

In DevOps, we define Continuous Deployment (CD) as the process of automatically
deploying your application based on certain conditions. Usually, those conditions
require running tests, verifying if the new version of the application has
deployed successfully and if it is working correctly. This may sound simple enough,
but instrumenting this kind of process can be a big challenge.

During this presentation I will start by shortly defining what CI/CD is, and the
benefits of using them. My main focus will be on three different deployment strategies:
blue-green, canary and rollback. Each of which, will be discussed in details,
covering the flow, the benefits and possible problems. I will be closing each section
with a live demo that showcases the flow, and how easy it is to implement it using
containers and built-in features of OpenShift.

After the session, you can play around with the accompanying code repository that
was used in the demo, which includes instructions how to run it on your own.
