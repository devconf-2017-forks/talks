# The power of CronJobs


## Description

In contrast to long running resources like Deployments and DaemonSets, Jobs allow
you to perform one-time batch tasks within a Kubernetes cluster.  Unfortunately,
with Job resource there is now way to specify how and when the Job should actually
be started.  There are plenty of reasons why you might want to defer a Job to a
later time, or to have a Job run on a recurring schedule.  Luckily, a new resource
called CronJob is here to solve this problem for you!

During this presentation, I will start by describing a Job resource, and how
easy it is to create a sample Job in Kuberentes.  I will also cover possible usage
areas with patterns for how to use Jobs to get the most of it.  From there, I will
move on to the CronJob.  Again, I will start with a short overview of the CronJob
resource itself.  Once I have covered the basics, I will dive into many of CronJobâ€™s
possible configuration options, and ways to use them to tweak how, and when a Job
will be scheduled.  Finally, I will touch on the current limitations (this is still
an alpha feature, under development), and future plans for Jobs and CronJobs, and
I will also try to clear up the confusion between ScheduledJobs and CronJobs
that was introduced in version 1.5.

This presentation will feature a number of live demos as we move from simple to
more advanced topics.  You will leave the talk ready to create a CronJob that can
index the internet every 2 hours!  Do not miss out on learning about one of the
most unusual and helpful features of Kubernetes!

## Audience

Attendees leaving the room will learn the basics about Jobs and CronJobs.  For
myself, I am hoping to gather feedback around those features during Q&A and include
it in plans for further releases.
