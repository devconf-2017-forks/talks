# Audit in Kubernetes now, and the future


## Description

Quoting Wikipedia “an audit is a systematic and independent examination of (...)
records”.  Now think for a second, how much information is floating through your
Kubernetes cluster.  Deployments, Jobs and many other controllers creating and
destroying Pods.  Administrators creating Users, granting Roles.  Users creating
and modifying ConfigMaps, Secrets and many, many others.  You can limit actions
performed by a single User creating Roles, controllers can be assigned ServiceAccounts,
etc, of course.  But even with all that in place, are you sure you can easily
trace when a change was introduced, and most importantly who performed it?
This is when auditing comes into play.

During this presentation, I will introduce what auditing is, and what you can
expect from one of the best hidden features of Kubernetes, and why should you
care.  I don't like just talking about ideas, so we’ll also walk through a live
demo showcasing the audit feature.
With all the current state laid out, I will discuss the future evolution of this
feature.  Most importantly, I will cover the scope of the information that should
be gathered during processing each request.  What policies should be implemented
to provide reasonable balance between performance and accountability.  Lastly,
I will cover the most sensitive topic, how to store all that information.

After this session you will understand how auditing in Kubernetes works, and how
to leverage it to stay informed about what goes on in your cluster.  Furthermore,
I am hoping this presentation will foster a discussion about advanced audit feature
and its shape in Kubernetes.

## Audience

Attendees leaving the room will learn the basics about auditing and what is currently
possible in Kubernetes.  For myself, I am hoping to gather feedback around the
advanced audit proposal during Q&A.
