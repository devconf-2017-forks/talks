# OpenShift on Fedora

## Description

Do you want to run your containerized applications on an all-Fedora platform?
Interested in deploying OpenShift on Fedora? Come help us make that a reality in
this Origin-on-Fedora hackfest. We'll be working on troubleshooting and building
an official Fedora Atomic Origin stack.

This will include showing some of the deployment options for Origin on Fedora,
as well as going over the current blockers and state of the project. Then we'll
get to hacking. Bring a laptop, and your Ansible, Ops, and/or Docker knowledge
to pitch in.
