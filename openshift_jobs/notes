# Running batch jobs at a scale

## Detailed abstract

When you hear words such as Kubernetes or OpenShift you immediately start thinking
about long running processes you can easily scale at will. Yet, there's a less known
feature, which allows you to run anything from simple to highly-complicated tasks.
I'm the author of the Job resource in both Kubernetes and OpenShift, and
during this presentation I will guide you through several techniques how to
perform anything ranging from simple Pi calculations to rendering a movie.
No matter if you're a data scientist running large scale calculations across
several data centers or a hobby programmer running simple day-to-day tasks
this presentation is to teach you how to efficiently use jobs either as-is or
as a nice building block for something bigger. The latter I'll explore in a
little more detail talking about future evolution of job resource in Kubernetes.

I don't like just talking about ideas; I prefer live action. This means my
presentation will be filled with quite a few live demos that will present the
covered ideas.
